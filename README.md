# -The-MatrixOperations_v_CUDA
Single Threading, Multi-Threading, CUDA GPU Multithreading - A Simple Comparison

*This repository is for code accrued for CoE 135 Project 2019

Introduction - 
Our mission for this project was to design a coding project relevant to our learnings throughout the course of CoE 135 - an introduction to operating systems.
We opted to conduct a study on the performance benefits of CPU Multithreading and GPU Multithreading (CUDA on laptop nvidia GPU models in particular) A matrix operation calculator was settled upon as the primary testing platform for the study due to its potential to be a highly demanding process.

"CUDA C++ is just one of the ways you can create massively parallel applications with CUDA. It lets you use the powerful C++ programming language to develop high performance algorithms accelerated by thousands of parallel threads running on GPUs. Many developers have accelerated their computation- and bandwidth-hungry applications this way, including the libraries and frameworks that underpin the ongoing revolution in artificial intelligence known as Deep Learning."
